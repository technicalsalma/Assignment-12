          Q.2. What are the different ways to manage a state in a React
          application?
        </h2>
        <h5 className="text-sxl text-secondary-900">
          There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in your
          React apps:
        </h5>
        <p>
          <b>
            <u>Local (UI) state Local state:</u>
          </b>
          Local (UI) state Local state is data we manage in one or another
          component. Local state is most often managed in React using the
          useState hook.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            <u>Global (UI) state Global state:</u>
          </b>
          Global (UI) state Global state is data we manage across multiple
          components. Global state is necessary when we want to get and update
          data anywhere in our app, or in multiple components at least.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            <u>Server state:</u>
          </b>
          Server state Data that comes from an external server that must be
          integrated with our UI state. Server state is a simple concept, but
          can be hard to manage alongside all of our local and global UI state.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            <u>URL state:</u>
          </b>
          Data that exists on our URLs, including the pathname and query
          parameters. URL state is often missing as a category of state, but it
          is an important one. In many cases, a lot of major parts of our
          application rely upon accessing URL state. Try to imagine building a
          blog without being able to fetch a post based off of its slug or id
          that is located in the URL!

        <h2 className="text-xl text-secondary-900 font-bold">
          Q.3. How does prototypical inheritance work?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add
          methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object
          can inherit the properties and methods of another object.
          Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object,
          we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.

        <h2 className="text-xl text-secondary-900 font-bold">
          Q.4. What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test
          and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an important
          step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can
          help detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in
          later testing stages.

          {" "}
          Q.5.Why you do not set the state directly in React. For example, if
          you have const [products, setProducts] = useState([]). Why you do not
          set products = [...] instead, you use the setProducts
        </h2>
        <p>
          We should never update the state directly because of the following
          reasons: If you update it directly, calling the setState() afterward
          may just replace the update you made. When you directly update the
          state, it does not change this.state immediately. Instead, it creates
          a pending state transition, and accessing it after calling this method
          will only return the present value. You will lose control of the state
          across all components.
